# PUEO Reader

This should be a simple tool for reading full-waveform PUEO ROOTified flight data.

Because this is "simple", there will be minimal bells and whistles. Only the direct data and direct derivations of the data will be accessible in this reader.

Please read the documentation and comments. And please notify me of any issues or corrections.
